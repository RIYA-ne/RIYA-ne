Save Your Work: Go to File > Save As and save your project as a .PSD file for future editing.
Experiment 4 :- Skin Retouching



Launch Photoshop & Open Image: Start Photoshop and open the portrait image you want to retouch (File > Open).
Create a Duplicate Layer: Press Ctrl + J to duplicate the original image layer. This allows for non-destructive editing.
Remove Blemishes: Select the Spot Healing Brush Tool (J) and click on blemishes, acne, or small imperfections to remove them.
Detailed Retouching: For more precise control, use the Healing Brush Tool or Clone Stamp Tool (S) on a new blank layer, making sure to check "Sample All Layers" in the options bar.
(Optional) Frequency Separation for Advanced Editing:
Duplicate the image layer twice.
Apply Gaussian Blur to the lower duplicate to smooth out tones.
On the top duplicate, use Apply Image to extract texture, then set the blend mode to Linear Light.
Retouch the blurred layer for color and tone, and the texture layer for skin details.
Smooth the Skin: Use the Mixer Brush Tool for natural blending or apply Surface Blur (Filter > Blur > Surface Blur) with gentle settings to smooth skin without losing texture.
Dodge & Burn for Contouring:
Create two Curves Adjustment Layers—one brightened (Dodge) and one darkened (Burn).
Invert their masks and use a soft white brush to paint light and shadow, enhancing the facial structure.
Enhance Eyes & Lips: Zoom in and use the Dodge Tool to brighten highlights and the Burn Tool to deepen shadows.
Use Hue/Saturation adjustments to subtly enhance eye color or lip tone if desired.
Color Correction: Use Curves, Selective Color, or Color Balance adjustments to unify skin tones and give the image a warmer or more polished look.
Final Review & Save: Zoom out and toggle layer visibility to review your edits.
Save your work as a .PSD file for future changes (File > Save As).
Export the final image as JPEG or PNG for sharing or printing.


Experiment 5 :- Text Masking


Create a New Document: Open Photoshop and go to File > New. Set your preferred dimensions and resolution (e.g., 1920×1080 pixels at 300 DPI).

Position the Text: Use the Move Tool (V) to resize and center the text on the canvas as needed.
Insert an Image: Open the image you want to place inside the text (File > Open), then drag it into your working document.
Resize and Position the Image: Press Ctrl + T to activate the Transform Tool, and resize the image so it fully covers the text area.
Layer Arrangement: In the Layers panel, ensure the image layer is placed directly above the text layer.
Create a Clipping Mask: Right-click on the image layer and choose "Create Clipping Mask".
  The image will now appear only through the shape of the text.
Fine-Tune the Composition: Use the Move Tool (V) or Ctrl + T to adjust the image’s position or scale to best fit within the text.
Add Visual Effects: Double-click the text layer to open Layer Style options. Add effects like Stroke, Drop Shadow, or Outer Glow to enhance the look.
Save and Export: Save your project as a .PSD file for future edits. To use or share the image, go to File > Export > Export As, and save it as a JPEG or PNG.
